        <h2>What is your Overarching Goal?</h2>
        <br />
        <h5>It is best to optimize by picking ONE goal. Stay focused on that one before moving onto the next one.</h5>
        <br />
         Examples:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <p>Why are you doing what you are doing? What do you hope to accomplish?</p>
          <p>What would your ideal 60th birthday look like?</p>
          <p>What would be the biggest regret you could have at the end of your life?</p>
          <p>18 months from now, what achievement would have the biggest positive impact on your life?</p>
          <p>Have you ever had the feeling that a discipline or field was tailor-made for you personally?</p>
          <p>What completely consumes your attention once you start doing it?</p>
          <p>What makes your heart race with excitement?</p>
          <p>Do you believe that some things are worth doing, even though others, perhaps, would not agree?</p>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h5>On Subgoals: by taking small, measurable steps regularly, we will be on track to the end.
        </h5>
        <br />
        <p>It is best to have a max of 3 subgoals going on at once</p>
        <p>Formulate the ONE goal into a number</p>
        <p>Make it very descriptive. Be specific. Force yourself to think about it.</p>
